# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9

**Example 1**:
```js
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

```
**Example 2**:
```js
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

```
**Note**:

* The linked list will have at least two elements.
* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
* Do not return anything from your function.

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;//没有删除节点，而是把后面的节点转移到改节点上
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```
链接表的删除，没啥好说的
