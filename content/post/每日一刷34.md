# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1**:
```js
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

```

**Example 2**:

```js
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

```

**Example 3**:
```js
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {   
        int n = prices.length;
        if (n<1){
            return 0;
        }
        int dp[] = new int[n];
        dp[0] = 0;
        int buy = prices[0];
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {//第一次循环，记录单次收益最大值
            buy = Math.min(buy,prices[i-1]);
            int sell = prices[i];
            max = Math.max(max,sell-buy);
            dp[i] = max;
        }
        max = 0;//清空max，再来一次右边到左边的循环
        int totalmax = 0;
        int sell = prices[n-1];
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0 ; i--) {
            buy = prices[i];
            sell = Math.max(sell, prices[i + 1]);
            max = Math.max(max, sell - buy);
            int remain = 0;//之前的dp数组，代表左边的数据
            if (i > 1) {
                remain = dp[i - 1];
            }
            totalmax = Math.max(totalmax, remain + max);
        }
        return totalmax;
    }
}
```
这道题说难不难，说简单也不能算简单，关键是要想到把数组分成两半，各自都回了股票问题的的最简单的形态，就是求单次最大利润，分成两半后求左边一次最大的，右边一次最大的，两者做个分界点分离之后再求它的和的最大值，这道题的解法算是自底向上的方法，先做了一个dp数组，接下去用到了该数组的值来进行演算。
